MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION PARSER

Takes an expression like "1 - (0.5 * 1.1)^2" and evaluates it.
Supported infix operators: + - * / ^
Expressions can be abstracted using user-defined functions and variables.

Expressions can either be passed by command-line arguments or entering the
parser in interactive mode.
